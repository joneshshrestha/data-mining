"""
This Python script performs character counting and merging operations on a text file.

Usage:
1. Ensure that the text file 'HadoopBlurb.txt' is located in the same directory as this script.
2. Run this script using Python 3.x.

Example. Run the below command to execute the script:
    $ python count_merge.py --file-path path/to/HadoopBlurb.txt

This script will:
- Read the text file 'HadoopBlurb.txt'.
- Compute the total character count using a dictionary, excluding spaces and special characters.
- Create three different character count dictionaries, assigning characters at random.
- Merge the three dictionaries into one, adding the counts.
- Print the character counts, random character count dictionaries, and merged character count dictionary.
- Perform a test to check if the merged counts match the initial character counts.
